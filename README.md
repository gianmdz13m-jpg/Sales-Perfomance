# Project Background
This project was done using a synthetic dataset of a fictional online videogame store that saw an increase in revenue during the pandemic year of 2020. The aim is to analyze this data to uncover insights that would improve the company's commercial success.

Insights and recommendations are provided on the following key areas:

- Sales Trends Analysis: An Evaluation of historical sales patterns focusing on Revenue, Order Volume and Average Order Value.
- Product Level Perfomance: An Analysis of the products sold by the store, to understand their impact on sales.
- Marketing Channels Comparison: An Evaluation of sales and orders by marketing channel.
- Regional Comparison: An Evaluation of sales and orders by region.

An interactive PowerBI dashboard can be viewed here.
